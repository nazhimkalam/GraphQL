# GraphQL 📈

- ## **GraphQL** is a query language for **APIs** and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- ## **GraphQL** provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for **exactly what they need and nothing more**, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

- ## **GraphQL** queries always return predictable results. 
- ## Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because **they control the data they get**, not the server

- ## Example :

    - ### Ask for what you want.
            {
                hero {
                    name
                    height
                    mass
                }
            }
    - ### Get predictable result.

            {
                "hero": {
                    "name": "Luke Skywalker",
                    "height": 1.72,
                    "mass": 77
                }
            }
